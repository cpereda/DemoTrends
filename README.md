Mapping demographic trend data of the US between 1993-2003

I am currently enrolled in New York Data Science Academy. This is my first project, a shiny app that will allow users to explore demographic trends across the US. 

Original data from [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/community-health-status-indicators-chsi-to-combat-obesity-heart-disease-and-cancer#sec-dates). Data is currently accessible https://data.world/data-society/health-status-indicators
